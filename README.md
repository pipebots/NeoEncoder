# NeoEncoder

Code to control 2 NeoPixel rings by reading the encoder interrupts from the two motors using an Arduino Nano 33 Sense. The NeoPixel rings were fitted to the first Pipebot robot called Sprintbot.

Here is a [video of the rings](VID_20200320_230713.mp4) being controlled.

The code was built using PlatformIO.
